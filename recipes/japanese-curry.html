    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <p><em>Hella</em> Rice</p>
        <p>Chicken Breast</p>
        <p>Curry Sauce Mix</p>
        <p>Carrots</p>
        <p>Potatoes</p>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Steps to Follow</em></h4>
        <p>Make sure that you have the willpower to eat something this good</p>
        <p>Ally yourself with the carrots and potatoes</p>
        <p><em>OH NO!</em> The chicken <strong>hates</strong> the carrots</p>
        <p>There must next be a full blown war with Veggies vs Chicken and the rice is like Switzerland</p>
        <p> It was all required, it tastes perfect and should now be complete</p>
